# HTML Validator App

## Overview

The HTML Validator App is a Contentful sidebar extension that validates the content of a rich text field. If the field contains HTML, the entry is disabled from being published. This ensures clean, HTML-free content for your entries.

## Features

- Validates rich text field content for HTML tags.
- Displays a message indicating if the entry is ready to publish or requires HTML removal.
- Prevents the entry from being published if HTML is detected.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaffexd/html-validator-app.git
   cd html-validator-app

2. Adjust the fields as you need to, currently it reads from an example "Title" field in my content model.
